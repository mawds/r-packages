This will be a lesson on writing packages for R

Ideas for the subject of our tutorial package:

1. Something to do with weather - pull current weather from weather API
   Could get different cities.  Perhaps plot on a map? Complex; risk of
   API changing. Potential for graphical output - would look good.
2. Calculate the area / volume of shapes / solids.  Simple example, easy
   for participants to extend. Rather dull?
